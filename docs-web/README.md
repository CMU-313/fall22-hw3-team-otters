# Evaluations Page

On the Teedy website, you can access the 'Evaluations' page by clicking on the link in the middle of the top index bar. Here, as a reviewer, you can enter your scores for a student applicant and view the average evaluation for that student.

## Testing

Click into the 'Evaluations' page. On the left hand side (or the top), there is a form to enter a reviewer's name, their scores for the candidate's skill and experience, and whether they think the applicant should be hired (admitted) or not.

Try entering the following values:
- Reviewer Name: Test1
- Skill: 4
- Experience: 2
- Hire: yes

Press the 'Submit' button. On the right hand side (or the bottom), a new row should appear in the evaluations table with their respective values.

Enter another evaluation with the following values:
- Reviewer Name: Test2
- Skill: 1
- Experience: 4
- Hire: no

Now, press the 'Calculate Average' button above the evaluations table. A new row should appear at the bottom of the table with the name 'Average' and the average values of the rest of the scores. In this case, it should be:
- Reviewer Name: Average
- Skill: 2
- Experience: 3
- Hire: 0 (maybe)
